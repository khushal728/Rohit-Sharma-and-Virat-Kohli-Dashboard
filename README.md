# 🏏 Ro-Ko Test Cricket Tribute Dashboard

A heartfelt data visualization project built as a tribute to **Rohit Sharma** and **Virat Kohli** on their retirement from **Test Cricket**.  
This dashboard is not just about stats — it’s a celebration of memories, records, and the legacy of two cricketing legends who inspired an entire generation.

## 💡 Why I Built This

I've grown up watching Ro-Ko — from Virat's iconic chases to Rohit's graceful sixes. Their retirement from Test cricket feels like the end of an era.

This dashboard is my small way of saying *thank you*.
